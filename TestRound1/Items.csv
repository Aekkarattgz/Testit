Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s  when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries  but also the leap into electronic typesetting  remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages  and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.,Smoking is not allowed.,1,10000
24,4,5,Coopie House 2,5,4,1,1,36-1 Indong-ri  Gangdong-myeon,Indong-ri  Gangdong-myeon,It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters  as opposed to using 'Content here  content here'  making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text  and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years  sometimes by accident  sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).,Pets are not allowed.,1,10000
25,4,3,Orakai Insadong Suites,10,8,5,3,337 Ungjin-dong (12 Gwangwangdanji-gil),(12 Gwangwangdanji-gil),There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available  but the majority have suffered alteration in some form  by injected humour  or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum  you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text.
